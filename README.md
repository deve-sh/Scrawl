# ðŸ““ Scrawl - Git backed Notes

---

### Why?

Note taking is something everyone does, but most note taking applications:

- Do not have revision history
- Do not allow you to go back to a specific point in time
- And most importantly: Have your data stored on a Cloud that you don't have access to or control over.

What is the best solution to revision history? Well, it's **Git**, the battle tested change logging software, and what's the best place to store your Git Repository? Any Git Provider like GitHub or even a self hosted service if you want.

Scrawl combines the best of great note taking experiences with the ability to store them locally as well, view changelogs and back them up to the cloud using a Git Repository.
